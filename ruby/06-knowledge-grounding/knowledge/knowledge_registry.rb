# This registry is:
# - Read-only during runtime
# - Global (not session-scoped)
# - Passive (no retrieval, no reasoning)
#
# It is the single source of truth for:
# - What documentation exists
# - What authority it has
# - Which domain it applies to
#
# Phase: v0.6.0
# Responsibility: Governance and inspection ONLY.
#
# Extended in v0.6.1+ to expose a shared default instance.
