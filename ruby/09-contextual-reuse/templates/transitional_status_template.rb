# ============================================================
# TransitionalStatusTemplate
#
# Introduced in: v0.10
#
# Purpose:
# - Explain non‑blocking, non‑terminal lifecycle states
# - Provide visibility, not guidance
#
# Design Constraints:
# - Must NOT include operational steps
# - Must NOT suggest UI actions
# - Must remain faithful to handbook semantics
