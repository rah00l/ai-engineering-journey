# TerminalStatusTemplate
#
# v0.9.0 — Guided Status & Error Workflows
#
# PURPOSE:
# Provides guided explanations for terminal system statuses.
#
# Terminal statuses represent COMPLETED lifecycle states.
# They indicate that no further processing or user action is required.
#
# DESIGN CONSTRAINTS:
# - Must not suggest next steps
# - Must not trigger workflows
# - Must not reopen reasoning chains
#
# MILESTONE CONTEXT:
# - v0.7 grounding confirms the terminal status authoritatively
# - v0.8 intent mediation resolves the user’s question
# - v0.9 formats the terminal meaning safely for humans
#
# This template currently supports:
# - FULL_RECONCILED
