# ExplanationContract
#
# v0.9.0 — Guided Status & Error Workflows
#
# PURPOSE:
# Defines the formal structure of a guided explanation.
# This contract ensures that all explanations are:
#   - complete
#   - consistent
#   - auditable
#   - safe (no hallucinated guidance)
#
# IMPORTANT DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
# - This struct defines SHAPE only, not behavior.
# - No logic, no inference, no defaults.
# - Every explanation produced in v0.9 MUST conform to this contract.
#
# MILESTONE CONTEXT:
# - v0.7.x determines WHAT is true (grounding)
# - v0.8.0 determines WHAT the user means (intent mediation)
# - v0.9.0 determines HOW the grounded truth is explained to humans
#
# FUTURE NOTE:
# Later milestones (v1.x+, v2.x) may consume this struct
# for UI, automation, or evaluation — do NOT change lightly.

ExplanationContract = Struct.new(
  :concept_type,        # Symbol — e.g. :status, :status_blocking, :error_mapping
  :blocking,            # true | false | :temporary
  :ownership,           # String — who is responsible (Accounting, Ops, Support)
  :meaning,             # String — document-safe interpretation
  :impact,              # String — what cannot proceed because of this
  :typical_next_step,   # Optional String — generic, non-procedural guidance
  :notes,               # Optional String — caveats or clarifications
  keyword_init: true
) do

  # Converts the ExplanationContract into a structured hash
  # suitable for JSON serialization.
  #
  # IMPORTANT:
  # - This controls presentation, not logic.
  # - Do not embed business rules here.
