#
# v0.9.0 — Guided Status & Error Workflows
#
# PURPOSE:
# Provides guided explanations for non-error system statuses.
#
# Statuses represent VALID system states, not failures.
# They may still be blocking or require follow-up, but:
# - they are not errors
# - they must not trigger remediation workflows
#
# MILESTONE CONTEXT:
# - v0.7.x provides raw, authoritative status definitions
# - v0.8.0 resolves user intent to a canonical term
# - v0.9.0 adds structured explanations for selected statuses
#
# This template currently supports:
# - PARTIAL_RECONCILED
#
# Extension rule:
# - New statuses must be explicitly added
# - Do NOT infer behavior from naming or text
