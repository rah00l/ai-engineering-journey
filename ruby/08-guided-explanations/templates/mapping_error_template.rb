# MappingErrorTemplate
#
# v0.9.0 — Guided Status & Error Workflows
#
# PURPOSE:
# Provides a deterministic explanation strategy for mapping errors.
#
# Mapping errors represent DATA INTEGRITY FAILURES that:
# - block reconciliation
# - require human correction
# - must never be auto-remediated
#
# DESIGN CONSTRAINTS:
# - Explanations must be document-safe
# - No speculative root cause analysis
# - No UI or system instructions
# - No automation logic
#
# MILESTONE CONTEXT:
# Mapping errors could not be explained in v0.7 (grounding-only)
# and v0.8 (intent-only). v0.9 introduces controlled explanation.
